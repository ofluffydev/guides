        Welcome to a growing collection of articles, tutorials, and
        community-driven resources. This project is powered by people like
        you—whether you're seeking technical help with programming/computers,
        support to get through tough days, answers to LGBTQIA+ questions, or
        just about anything else, this platform is here to help.

        I created this website to extend a helping hand to as many people as
        possible—not just one person at a time, but a whole community. Together,
        we can make sure everyone finds the support they need.

        The structure is made to be simple and easy to navigate, starting with
        high level topics, and having sub-categories for more specific topics.
